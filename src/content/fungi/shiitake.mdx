Shiitake mushrooms have been cultivated for over 1,000 years in Japan and China. Today, they are the second most popular cultivated mushroom in the world, and it's easy to see why. With their rich, earthy flavor and meaty texture, shiitakes are a staple in cuisines worldwide.

## Growing at Dart Valley

We grow our shiitake mushrooms on locally sourced oak logs, following traditional methods that produce the most flavorful results. The logs are inoculated with shiittake mycelium and allowed to mature for several months before the first harvest.

## Flavor Profile

Shiitakes are famous for their intense umami flavor:

- **Fresh**: Savory, earthy, with a slight garlic undertone
- **Dried**: Even more concentrated - rehydrate for maximum flavor
- **Texture**: Firm and meaty, holds up well to cooking

## Health Benefits

Shiitakes are not just delicious - they're also nutritious:

- Rich in B vitamins (B2, B5, B6)
- Good source of minerals (selenium, zinc, manganese)
- Contains lentinan, a compound with potential health benefits
- Low in calories

## Cooking Tips

- Always cook shiitakes (they're tough raw)
- Don't waste the stems - slice thin and add to stocks
- Dried shiitakes should be rehydrated in warm water (save the soaking liquid for soup!)
- Slice thick for grilling or stir-fries

## Storage

Fresh shiitakes can be refrigerated for up to two weeks. Dried shiitakes should be stored in an airtight container in a cool, dark place and will keep for up to a year.
