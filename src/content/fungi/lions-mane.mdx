Lion's Mane is one of nature's most striking mushrooms, with cascading spines that resemble a lion's mane. This magnificent fungus is celebrated both for its unique appearance and its remarkable culinary and medicinal properties.

## Growing at Dart Valley

Lion's Mane requires more careful growing conditions than oyster mushrooms. We cultivate them on hardwood sawdust supplemented with bran, maintaining precise temperature and humidity levels. The result is mushrooms with pristine white spines and exceptional flavor.

## Culinary Profile

What makes Lion's Mane special is its flavor profile - often described as similar to lobster or crab meat:

- **Raw**: Can be eaten raw, with a slightly sweet, nutty taste
- **Sautéed**: Butter and herbs bring out its natural sweetness
- **Tempura**: Light and crispy, perfect for this preparation
- **Extracted**: Makes excellent teas and tinctures

## Medicinal Properties

Lion's Mane has been used traditionally in Asian medicine for centuries. Modern research suggests it may:

- Support cognitive function and memory
- Promote nerve growth factor
- Have anti-inflammatory properties
- Support immune health

## Our Favorite Way to Prepare

Simply slice the mushroom and sauté in butter with fresh thyme, a squeeze of lemon, and a pinch of sea salt. This highlights its natural sweetness and delicate texture.
