The Oyster Mushroom is one of the most popular gourmet mushrooms worldwide, and for good reason. These beautiful fungi feature delicate, fan-shaped caps that range in color from creamy white to soft gray and warm brown.

## Growing at Dart Valley

At our Devon farm, we grow oyster mushrooms on a substrate made from upcycled agricultural waste, including coffee grounds from local cafes and straw from regional farms. This sustainable approach not only produces delicious mushrooms but also reduces waste that would otherwise end up in landfills.

## Culinary Uses

Oyster mushrooms are incredibly versatile in the kitchen:

- **Sautéed**: Simply sauté in butter with garlic for a quick side dish
- **Stir-fries**: Their tender texture absorbs flavors beautifully
- **Soups**: Add depth to any broth or stew
- **Crispy**: Slice thin and fry until golden for a delicious snack

## Health Benefits

Oyster mushrooms are low in calories but rich in nutrients:

- High in protein and fiber
- Good source of B vitamins
- Contains beta-glucans for immune support
- Rich in antioxidants

## Storage Tips

Fresh oysters should be stored in the refrigerator in a paper bag (not plastic) and used within 5-7 days for optimal freshness and flavor.
