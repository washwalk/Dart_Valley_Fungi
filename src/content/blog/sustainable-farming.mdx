excerpt: How we're turning agricultural waste into gourmet mushrooms and supporting a more sustainable food system.

At Dart Valley Fungi, we believe that great food shouldn't come at the cost of our planet. That's why we've built our farm around a simple principle: grow delicious mushrooms while turning waste into value.

## The Problem with Food Waste

Did you know that the UK generates around 9.5 million tonnes of food waste each year? Much of this ends up in landfills, where it produces methane - a greenhouse gas 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide.

Meanwhile, conventional mushroom farming often relies on resources that could be better used elsewhere. We saw an opportunity to do things differently.

## Our Approach: Circular Agriculture

We practice what we call "circular agriculture" - where waste from one process becomes the input for another:

### Upcycled Substrates

The substrate (growing medium) for our mushrooms is made from:

- **Coffee grounds** from local cafes and restaurants
- **Straw** from nearby organic farms
- **Sawdust** from sustainable timber operations
- **Agricultural by-products** from local producers

By using these materials, we keep waste out of landfills while creating the perfect environment for mushrooms to thrive.

### Local Partnerships

We work with amazing local producers:

- **Barnaby's Brewhouse** supplies spent grain from their beer production
- **Riverford Dairy** provides organic whey
- Local cafés give us their coffee grounds

These partnerships create a truly local food system where everyone's waste becomes someone else's resource.

## The Science of Sustainability

Mushrooms are uniquely positioned in the sustainability conversation:

- **Low water usage**: Mushrooms need far less water than most crops
- **No pesticides**: Our growing conditions don't require chemicals
- **Minimal land use**: Vertical farming techniques maximize yield per square meter
- **Carbon negative potential**: Our substrate actually sequesters carbon

## What This Means for You

When you buy from Dart Valley Fungi, you're not just getting great mushrooms:

- You're supporting local circular economy
- You're reducing agricultural waste
- You're choosing sustainable food production
- You're getting the freshest, most flavorful mushrooms possible

## Looking Forward

We're constantly experimenting with new substrates and growing methods. Our goal is to prove that sustainable food production can be delicious, profitable, and good for the planet.

Have ideas about how we could be even more sustainable? We'd love to hear from you!
