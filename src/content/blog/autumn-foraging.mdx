excerpt: What to look for as the season turns, and how to forage responsibly in our beautiful corner of England.

As the days grow shorter and the forests of Devon take on their golden hue, a hidden world awakens beneath the canopy. Autumn is the prime season for mushroom foraging, and our region offers incredible diversity for those who know where to look.

## Responsible Foraging

Before we dive into what to find, let's discuss how to forage responsibly:

1. **Never take more than you need** - Leave plenty for wildlife and other foragers
2. **Know your species** - Only eat mushrooms you're 100% certain about
3. **Respect the land** - Only forage with permission and on public paths
4. **Leave no trace** - Take only mushrooms, leave only footprints

## What to Look For

### Chanterelles (Cantharellus cibarius)
These golden beauties are among the most prized edible fungi. Look for them in mossy, deciduous woodland, particularly under birch and oak. Their distinctive trumpets and apricot aroma make them relatively easy to identify.

### Porcini (Boletus edulis)
The king of mushrooms, porcini are found beneath pine trees in sandy soil. Their thick stems and brown caps are unmistakable, and their nutty, earthy flavor lives up to the hype.

### Wood Blewits (Clitocybe nuda)
These purple-tinged mushrooms appear late in autumn, often after the first frosts. They're excellent in creamy sauces and stews.

## Safety First

No foraging article is complete without a warning: never eat a mushroom you cannot positively identify. When in doubt, leave it out. Consider joining a local foraging group or taking a guided walk with an expert before venturing out alone.

## Local Resources

- **Dartmoor National Park**: Excellent foraging opportunities (follow park rules)
- **Woodland Trust sites**: Many are open for responsible foraging
- **Local foraging groups**: Check Facebook for Devon Foraging Club
